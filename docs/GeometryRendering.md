KML and GeoJSON rendering
=========================
As of version 2.0.0 we have added new features for rendering KML and GeoJSON inputs. This first
version supports common geometries like Point, Polyline, Polygon, GroundOverlay. Please note that
this version does not support interaction with the rendered geometries.

The following screenshot shows a demo of a KML file being rendered on the map. See
[KMLViewController][kmlviewcontroller] for how to use the new APIs.
